# Weather Data Visualizer – Summary Report

## 1. Dataset Description
- Source: (Kaggle / IMD / other – mention link / name)
- Location and time period covered
- Number of rows and columns
- Important variables: Temperature, Rainfall, Humidity, Date, etc.

## 2. Data Cleaning
- Converted Date column to datetime
- Removed rows with missing values in key columns
- Selected only relevant columns
- Final dataset size after cleaning

## 3. Statistical Analysis
- Daily statistics: mean, min, max, std for temperature, rainfall, humidity
- Monthly averages and totals
- Yearly trends (if your data covers multiple years)
- Any interesting numbers (e.g., highest temperature, heaviest daily rainfall)

## 4. Visualizations
### 4.1 Daily Temperature Trend
- Refer to `daily_temperature_trend.png`
- Describe the overall pattern: increasing, decreasing, fluctuations, heat waves, cold days, etc.

### 4.2 Monthly Rainfall Totals
- Refer to `monthly_rainfall_bar.png`
- Mention which months are driest and which are rainiest.

### 4.3 Humidity vs Temperature
- Refer to `humidity_vs_temperature_scatter.png`
- Do you see any correlation? (e.g., higher humidity when temperature is moderate?)

### 4.4 Combined Plot
- Refer to `combined_plots.png`
- Explain how combining helps compare trends.

## 5. Grouping and Aggregation Insights
- Discuss patterns by month / season
- Which season has:
  - highest average temperature?
  - highest total rainfall?
  - highest average humidity?

## 6. Conclusion
- Summarize the main climate insights for the location.
- Mention how this kind of analysis can help campus sustainability or planning.
- Possible extensions: more variables, interactive dashboard, comparison of multiple cities, etc.
